    javascript

    microsoft  introduced jscript

    uses of javascript
    1) frontend development
    2) backend - node js
    3) app development - react native
    4) game developement
    5) iot
    6) standalone applications

    javascript- dynamic websites
    javascript is a high level programming 
    language that is used to create 
    interactive and dynamic nature to the website
    
    it was introduced by brendan eich
    in 1995 
    created within 10days
  
    ecma script
    es1-1997
    es2-1998
    es3-1999
    es5-2009
    es6-2015..pre requistic for react


    features of javascript
    1) dynamically typed language
    2) highlevel language
    3) interpreted -compiled - Just in time compilation
    4) cross platform
    5) synchronous and asynchronous
    6) single threaded- it will execute one line at a time

    how js runs your code
    1) parser- it will check for the errors
       ast- abstract syntax tree-code converted into tokens
    2) compilation- interpreted converts code line by line
    3) execution - output


    
    line1   synchronous
    line2 ...10mins----asynchronous
    line3----synchrnous
1000lines   --synch

    output
    line 1
    line 3
    1000lines

    line2....async


    output
    line1
    10mins line2
    10mins line3

    output
    line1
    line2
    line3

javascript event loop mechanism
javascript execution flow

1) callstack-it will execute the programs and 
          categorize
2) webapi- it will provide some features
     like fetch, timers, events
3) callback que- it is the datastructure
   where the async programs will wait
4) eventloop- it will check the callstack
   and callback que for proper execution

   synchronous- the code which will execute
   immediately
   asynchronous- the code which always takes
   time and executes parallely

   inside every browser we have engines
   chrome -v8 
   edge-chakra
   firefox- spidermonkey


   day2 task

write a javascript alert in internal , external, inline 

Create a simple JavaScript script that declares three different
 types of variables (var, let, and const) and
  prints their values to the console.

Create variables of different data types: number, string, boolean, 
undefined, null, object, array, and function

Use the typeof operator to log the type of each variable
 to the console
   



day3 task
Write a JavaScript script that compares two variables using 
different comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=) and prints the results.

Expand the script to include a ternary operation 
that checks if a user is an adult (18+) or a minor.

Grade Classification: Declare a variable score and 
set it to a value between 0 and 100.
 Use nested ternary operators to classify the score into grades:
  A (>= 90), B (>= 75), C (>= 60), D (>= 45), and F (below 45).
   Log the grade.

 Temperature Check: Declare a variable temperature and 
 use nested ternary operators to categorize it as "Hot" (above 30),
  "Warm" (20-30), "Cool" (10-19), and "Cold" (below 10). 
  Log the result.

 Age Group: Declare a variable age and 
 use the ternary operator to classify the age into "Child"
  (0-12), "Teen" (13-19), "Adult" (20-64), 
  and "Senior" (65 and above). Log the result
