        scopes 
        it is a life or accessibility of an variable

        global scope
        variables that are declared at global level
        having a global scope means we can access 
        anywhere in the programs
        var ,let and const have global scope
        var a=10
        console.log(a)
        {
        console.log(a)
        }
        function fun(){
        console.log(a)
          } 
        fun()
        
        block scope
        variables that are declared in a block
         can be accessed only  within the block 
        let and const have a block scope
      {
        var a=10
        let b=20
        const c=30
    }
    console.log(a)
    console.log(b)//not defined
    console.log(c)//not defined

        local scope or function scope
        variables that are declared inside the function
        can only able to access within the funciton only
        var , let and const have local scope
        function fun(){
            var a=10
            let b=20
            const c=30
        }
        fun()
        console.log(a)//not defined
        console.log(b)//not defined
        console.log(c)//not defined
        
        debugger
 
      function fun()  {
 
            var a=10
                let b=20
                const c=30
                console.log(a,b,c)
        }
        fun()


        declaration
        var a;
        var a;redeclaration

        //assignment
        var a;
        a=10
        a=20

        //initialization
        var a=10

        hoisting
        console.log(a)
        var a=10;
        


        var
        scope- local scope and global scope
        redclaration is allowed
        assignment is allowed
        var can be hoisted and initialized with undefined

        let
        scope - global scope,local scope and block scope
        redclaration is not allowed
        assignment is allowed
        let also can be hoisted but doesn't initializes with
            undefined ,it was in tdz (tempororal dead zone)
        
        const 
        scope - global scope,local scope and block scope
        redclaration is not allowed
        assignment is not allowed  only intialization is allowed
        const also can be hoisted but doesn't initializes with
        undefined - it was in tdz (tempororal dead zone)

        scope chaining- how variable looks out for an value
        let a=10
        function fun(){
         let a=20
            {
            let a=30
            console.log(a)
            }
        }
        fun()

        closure
        closure is when a inner function can remember and update
       the variable which is declared in outer function 
        even after the exection
        function fun(){
            let count=0
            return function(){
                count++
            console.log(count)
        }
      }
      //   fun()()//1
    //   fun()()//1
    
    //   let a=fun()
    //   a()//1
    //   a()//2
    
    

    global execution context
    var a=10
    let b=20

    function fun(){
    }
